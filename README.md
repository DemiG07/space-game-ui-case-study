# 🚀 Astral Odessey UI – Mobile Game Interface Case Study

A mobile sci-fi game UI concept inspired by games like *ExoMiner*. This case study demonstrates my approach to designing clean, futuristic interfaces for mobile gameplay — focusing on HUD, menus, and iconography optimized for touch.

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Platform:** Mobile (Android / iOS)  
**Genre:** Sci-fi / Idle Mining / Base Building  
**Goal:** To create a visually cohesive and intuitive UI system for a sci-fi mining game that keeps the player immersed and engaged.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a modular UI kit tailored for mobile screen sizes.
- Develop a HUD with resource tracking, mining progress, and build controls.
- Create menu wireframes for inventory, upgrades, missions, and settings.
- Craft a consistent set of sci-fi-themed icons and visual cues.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- 🎨 Adobe Illustrator (main design work)
- 🖌 Figma (wireframes and structure planning)
- ✨ After Effects (motion testing)
- 📱 Android testing device (for scale & spacing)

## 🧪 UX Design Considerations

- **Thumb-friendly layout**: UI placement optimized for one-handed use.
- **Clarity under pressure**: HUD is readable and organized even during active mining.
- **Consistency**: Reusable visual language across buttons, icons, and alerts.
- **Feedback loops**: Visual signals for player actions (upgrades, collections, missions).
